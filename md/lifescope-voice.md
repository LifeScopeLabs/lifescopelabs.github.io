Browser Web Speech API allows for speech recognition and synthesis support in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari (partial). This API is super badass but no one ever uses it. 

# Requirements
- **MVP** Respond to simple voice commands
	- Examples
		- "Run Saved Search: [Search Name]"
		- "Show me [View Name]"
		- "Add [Provider Name]"
		- "What was the last thing I did?"
		- "What did I do today?"
		- "Tell me about [Person Name] and I"
	- Voice Response
		- "28 Events match your saved search"
		- "Today's List of events. You received a message from Jane at 5:44 pm saying...."
- Deep Voice Search
	- **MVP**: Structured search terms (who, what, when, where, why)
	- Natural Language Processing.

- Passively capture voice data (speech text and recording) and store in LIFESCOPE.
